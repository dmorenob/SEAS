## Introduction
SEAS is a set of Sentiment and Emotion Analysis Services according to NIF. The NLP Interchange Format (NIF) is an RDF/OWL-based format that aims to achieve interoperability between Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, language resources and annotations. NIF consists of specifications, ontologies and software, which are combined under the version identifier "2.0", but are versioned individually. 
Some of the services are based in [SAGA](https://github.com/gsi-upm/SAGA) and others are based on open source projects.
