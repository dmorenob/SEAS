## Introduction
gate.sa.modules  is a set of processing and linguistic resources, written in Java, developed to run sentiment and emotion analysis over text using [GATE](http://gate.ac.uk) plataform.
Because of the nature of GATE, the text format should be plain or XML.

The sentiment analysis modules are executed in embedded inside SEAS.

## Getting started
Whether you intend to use this repository as an user or as a developer, you should download the last release of [GATE Developer](https://gate.ac.uk/family/developer.html) in order to run the graphic mode of this tool. You can find it in its [download page](https://gate.ac.uk/download/#latest). This download will include GATE Developer and Embedded and requires at least Java 6 update 10, 1.6.0_10, in order to be run.
If you are not familiar with GATE, check out these [training modules](https://gate.ac.uk/conferences/training-modules.html) to understand what GATE can do.

If you are a developer, you should know that in order to develop our own processing resources using GATE Embedded (GATE APIs), a suitable Java Development Environment is required. We strongly recommend using [Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr1), because it's going to make easier the next configuration tasks.

For more information about the processing and linguistic resources, sentiment analysis modules and examples, please check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/gsi-upm/SAGA/wiki) or contact us through: [http://gsi.dit.upm.es](http://gsi.dit.upm.es)
